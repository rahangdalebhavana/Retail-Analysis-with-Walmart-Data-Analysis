# Retail-Analysis-with-Walmart-Data-Analysis

### Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of all, which are the **Super Bowl**, **Labour Day**, **Thanksgiving** and **Christmas**. 
### The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. 
### Part of the challenge presented by this competition is modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data. 
### Historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions are available.
